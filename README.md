# 🚀 Weekly Hackathon: Week One

This is the official instructions repository for Week One of $hackathon. 

Your mission is to build the ultimate Frames v2 starter experience.

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

Build a production-ready website + Frame v2 that helps developers start building frames immediately. Your solution should make it as easy as possible for new developers (or even no-code people) to get started with Frames.

There should be information about them, practical examples, and good documentation.

Take as a starting point the resources that are now on [framesv2.com](https://framesv2.com), but organized in a way that is more compelling to creators. Showcase the power of frames. Bridge the gap between them and people that want to create experiences on the internet.

## 📋 Requirements

- Production deployed website + Frame v2
- Mobile friendly
- Interactive examples + quick-start guide
- Must use an open source license allowing reuse and modification for any purpose
